Unzipping the file, we get two files, a .wav and a flash_dump which is a DOS executable. I tried the basic initial steps on the .wav that is exiftool, 
binwalk and strings. I also put the file in audacity and deepsound and found nothing there either. I tried analyzing the executable but couldn't figure 
out anything.
