Unzipping the file, we get two files, a .wav and a flash_dump which is a DOS executable. I tried the basic initial steps on the .wav that is exiftool, 
binwalk and strings. I also put the file in audacity and deepsound and found nothing there either. I tried analyzing the executable but couldn't figure 
out anything. I thought the file name of the .wav could be a hint (486_375MHz-1MSps-1MHz) but no luck there also.
