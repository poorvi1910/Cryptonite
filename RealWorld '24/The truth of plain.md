Decompressing the attachment, we get a tar.extracted directory and going into it we see a Secret.zip file and a pacap file.
I opened the pcap file in wireshark but could'nt find anything that would be useful.
When we try to unzip the secret.zip file we are asked for a password. I didn't know how to use the gitub repo link or the pcap file provided to get the password.
