Some basic stuff:

In ARM architecture, registers are often referred to by names like w0, w1, etc. These registers are used for various purposes, including holding function arguments, local variables, and intermediate values during computation. The w prefix stands for "word" and indicates that these registers hold 32-bit values.
In ARMv8-A architecture, x0 and x1 are 64-bit general-purpose registers. They are part of the register file, and each register can hold a 64-bit (8-byte) data value. 

the x prefix denotes the full 64-bit version of the register, and w (e.g., w0, w1) denotes the lower 32 bits of the same register.

The ldr instruction in ARM assembly language stands for "Load Register." It is used to load a value from memory into a register.	

.L2 is a local label used as a target for branching instructions. Labels in assembly language are markers that represent specific points in the code, and they are typically used for branching, looping, or as targets for jumps
bls (Branch if Less than or Equal)

b (Branch)

str(Store)


func1:
Allocates space for local variables on the stack.
Stores the first two function arguments (w0 and w1) in the stack.
Compares the values and branches to .L2 if w1 is less than or equal to w0.
Loads the appropriate value into w0 based on the comparison.
Restores the stack pointer and returns.

sub sp, sp, #16  —----- allocate 16 bytes on the stack

str w0, [sp, 12] —------ store w0 into [sp+12]

str w1, [sp, 8] —------ store w1 into [sp+8]

ldr w1, [sp, 12] —--------- load [sp+12] into w1

ldr w0, [sp, 8] —------ load [sp+8] into w0

cmp w1, w0 —---------- compare w1 and w0 => compare [sp+12] and [sp+8]

bls .L2 —-------- branch to .L2 if ls

ldr w0, [sp, 12] —--------- load [sp+12] into w0

b .L3 —--------branch to .L3


main:
Sets up a stack frame (stp and add instructions).
Stores some values in the stack.
Calls atoi on two different addresses in the stack to convert strings to integers.
Calls func1 with the results of the atoi calls.
Prints the result using printf.
Restores the stack frame and returns.

str x19, [sp, 16] # 3854998744

str w0, [x29, 44] #  915131509

mov w1, w0        # w1 ->  915131509

mov w0, w19       # w0 -> 3854998744

The cmp w1, w0 instruction compares the values in registers w1 and w0.
If w1 is less than or equal to w0 (bls condition is true), it branches to .L2.
If the branch is taken, it loads a value from memory (ldr w0, [sp, 8]), otherwise, it loads a different value (ldr w0, [sp, 12]).
The code then continues from the label .L3.

The main function calls atoi twice to convert the arguments to integers and then calls func1 to compare those two integers. Since 915131509≤3854998744 , the control flow goes to .L2. Now w0 = [sp+8] = 3854998744 = x0.Eventually, when printf is called, the value stored in x0 will be printed (calling convention). Hence this program prints 3854998744.

Converting 3854998744 to hexadecimal and placing in picoctf format:
The flag is picoCTF{E5C69CD8}
