Segmentation faults in C or C++ is an error that occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location it does not have permission to access. Generally, this error occurs when memory access is violated and is a type of general protection fault. 

Brief overview of the code:

It defines a buffer flag to store a flag read from a file and a maximum flag size FLAGSIZE_MAX.
There's a signal handler function sigsegv_handler that prints the flag and exits when a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) occurs.
The vuln function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow as it uses strcpy to copy the input string input into the local buffer buf2.
In the main function, it attempts to open a file named "flag.txt" to read the debugging flag. If the file doesn't exist, it prompts the user to create the file.
It sets the effective group ID to the real group ID to drop privileges.
It reads user input using gets() into the buffer buf1, making it susceptible to a buffer overflow.
The vuln function is called with the user input, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
It prints a message and exits.

gets() is called, and reads buf1 (the user input) onto the stack. This function is a vulnerability as it will write the user’s input to the stack without regard to its allocated length. The user can simply overflow this length, and the program will pass their input into the vuln() function to trigger a segmentation fault.

So now if we spam a large number of random characters into the input, the stack overflows and we get the flag.
