The website does not let us access the flsg using our regular browser. Hence we must let it use a custom browser with name picobrowser to give us the flag

If we Inspect the site by right clicking(On Chrome) and going to the three dots next to settings icon --> more tools --> network conditions, we get an option of using a custom user gaent. Hence putting the name 'picobrowser' and clicking on flag, the webite displays the flag.
