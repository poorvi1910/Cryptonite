When we right click the page and go to Ispect --> Sources, we see a folder called secret . Thus using that folder name we go the site http://saturn.picoctf.net:64727/secret
When we repeat the action we see a folder hidden. The next website gives a folder 'superhidden' This site finally gives us the flag in the source code.
